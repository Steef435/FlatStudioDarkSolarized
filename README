# FlatStudioDarkSolarized
A Solarized Dark recolor of the Gtk aspect of FlatStudioDark.

## Warning
This theme is broken. The original theme was severely outdated and this fork
hardly tries to fix it. Furthermore, the Gtk3 version is in a bad state,
mostly because I hardly use Gtk3 apps.

As you may have noticed I did something funny with selection coloring, 
selected\_fg\_color gets an accent and selected\_bg\_color hardly changes
(depending on the context). I tried to alter scales (progressbar) so that the
progress does get accented, but I haven't done much tests.

While I appreciate bug reports and suggestions, if they're not crucial you're
better off doing the bug wrangling yourself since, as I stated already, I
hardly use it.
